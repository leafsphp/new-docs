# Configuring .htaccess

## üë©‚Äçüè´ Explanation

Basically, we're trying to push all the requests made to the server to a single root file, so a request made to `/home.php` will be directed to the root file of our choice....usually `index.php`.

This complex sounding feature can be achieved by simply adding a `.htaccess` file to the root of our project directory.

## üìÑ The HTACCESS file

This is a basic example of an htaccess file. It basically re-routes all requests to our index.php file.

```htaccess
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteRule . index.php [L]
```

Save as `.htaccess` in your the same directory as your "root file"
