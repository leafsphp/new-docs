# üì≤ Routing

<p class="alert -info">
  Leaf v2.5.0 introduces Leaf router version 2.
  <a href="/#/leaf/v/2.5.0/routing/new">See what's new</a>
</p>

As explained [before](leaf/v/2.5.0/intro/htaccess), Leaf uses a single root file, to which all the server requests are redirected. Leaf then takes these requests and matches them to rules you have defined. The results are then displayed to the user. It's actually a very simple concept.

The router module is tied directly to Leaf Core, so once you initialize leaf, you can use routing

```php
$app = new Leaf\App;
```

## Router class

V2.5.0 introduces version 2 of the Leaf router which comes with bug fixes, usability improvements and a ton of new features with almost no change in it's API. This means you can use Leaf router as you've always used it but also enjoy a smoother ride and new features too.

***Issues generated from using Router methods staticly in v2.5.0-beta have all been resolved. With that, we guarantee 100% backward compatibility with previous versions' routers.***

```php
use Leaf\Router;

Router::get("/", "PagesController@index");

Router::run();
```

## üëã Using a different router

Although Leaf provides you with a default router, you are free to import and use any router you want.

1. Install whatever you want

```bash
composer require imaginary/router
```

2. Import and use it in your project

```php
$app = new Leaf\App;

// initialise imaginary router
$imr = new Imaginary\Router();

$imr->get("/", function() use($app) {
  // you can still use leaf modules
  $app->response()->json(["title" => "hello"]);
});
```

## ‚õ≥ Creating Routes

Back to the default router config, You can define application routes using proxy methods on the Leaf\App instance. Leaf supports different types of requests, let's look at them.

### GET

You can add a route that handles only GET HTTP requests with the Leaf router's get() method. It accepts two arguments:

- The route pattern (with optional named placeholders or PCRE based patterns)
- The route callback

```php
$app->get('/home', function() {
  // your code
});
```

### POST

You can add a route that handles only POST HTTP requests with the Leaf router's post() method. It accepts two arguments:

- The route pattern (with optional named placeholders or PCRE based patterns)
- The route callback

```php
$app->post('/users/add', function() use($request) {
  $user = $request->get('user');
  // create a new user
});
```

### PUT requests

You can add a route that handles only PUT HTTP requests with the Leaf router‚Äôs put() method. It accepts two arguments:

- The route pattern (with optional named placeholders or PCRE based patterns)
- The route callback

```php
$app->put('/book/edit/{id}', function($id) {
  // your code
});
```

### DELETE requests

You can add a route that handles only DELETE HTTP requests with the Leaf router's delete() method. It accepts two arguments:

- The route pattern (with optional named placeholders or PCRE based patterns)
- The route callback

```php
$app->delete('/quotes/{id}', function($id) {
  // delete quote
});
```

### OPTIONS requests

You can add a route that handles only OPTIONS HTTP requests with the Leaf router's options() method. It accepts two arguments:

- The route pattern (with optional named placeholders or PCRE based patterns)
- The route callback

```php
$app->options('/quotes/{id}', function($id) {
  // return headers
});
```

### PATCH requests

You can add a route that handles only PATCH HTTP requests with the Leaf router's patch() method. It accepts two arguments:

- The route pattern (with optional named placeholders or PCRE based patterns)
- The route callback

```php
$app->patch('/post/{id}', function($id) {
  // your code
});
```

### ALL requests

You can add a route that handles all HTTP requests with the Leaf router's all() method. It accepts two arguments:

- The route pattern (with optional named placeholders or PCRE based patterns)
- The route callback

```php
$app->all('/post/{id}', function($id) {
  // your code
});
```

### View

**`view` is no longer supported, as Leaf Blade is no longer default in Leaf. You'll have to manually show your views using `get`**

### Resource Routes

This section assumes you've read [working with controllers](leaf/v/2.5.0/routing/controller). In an MVC application, controllers play a major role as they're the bridge between your view and your model.

A resource route simply creates all the routes needed to successfully handle a particular feature. This sounds a bit bleak, let's look at an example.

```php
$app = new Leaf\App;

$app->resource("/posts", "PostsController");

$app->run();
```

The code above is equivalent to this:

```php
$app = new Leaf\App;

$this->match("GET|HEAD", "/posts", "$controller@index");
$this->post("/posts", "$controller@store");
$this->match("GET|HEAD", "/posts/create", "$controller@create");
$this->match("POST|DELETE", "/posts/{id}/delete", "$controller@destroy");
$this->match("POST|PUT|PATCH", "/posts/{id}/edit", "$controller@update");
$this->match("GET|HEAD", "/posts/{id}/edit", "$controller@edit");
$this->match("GET|HEAD", "/posts/{id}", "$controller@show");

$app->run();
```

Resource routes are handled by a [resource controller](leaf/v/2.5.0/routing/controller?id=resource-controller).

### Route "Hooking"

You can add a route that handles a couple of HTTP methods with the Leaf router's match() method. It accepts three arguments:

- The HTTP method(s) seperated by |
- The route pattern (with optional named placeholders or PCRE based patterns)
- The route callback

```php
$app->match('GET|POST', '/people', function() {
  // your code
});
```

### Running your routes

After setting all the routes, you'll need to dispatch the routes. This is achieved through Leaf's run() method.

```php
$app->run();
```

### Route options <sup class="new-tag-1">New</sup>

This is the biggest change Leaf router has seen over the period of a year. Route options simply allow you to configure the way groups and individual routes by passing in additional parameters. In actual sense, all new features were generated as a result of this single feature. Let's see how it works.

Leaf route handlers are usually callable functions like this:

```php
$app->get("/home", function() {
  echo "User Home";
});
```

Or sometimes controllers, like this:

```php
$app->get("/home", "HomeController@index");
```

This means there was no space to chain additional items to the route, this is solved by route options.

```php
$app->get("/home", ["name" => "home", function() {
    echo "User Home";
}]);
```

When an array is passed into a leaf route as the handler, leaf will take all `key => value` as options for that route, the first non key-value `function` or `controller` in the array is taken as the handler.

```php
$app->get("/form", ["name" => "userForm", "FormsController@index"]);
```

As mentioned before, this feature is also available on groups:

```php
$app->group("/user", ["namespace" => "\\", function() use($app) {
    // ...
}]);
```

**This doesn't mean that you should always pass in an array, if you don't need the other options, you can pass in your function or controller directly as you've always done.**

### Naming your routes <sup class="new-tag-1">New</sup>

From v2.5.0 of Leaf, you can give route names which you can call them with instead of using the path (Inspired by vue-router).

```php
$app->get("/home", ["name" => "home", function() {
  echo "User Home";
}]);
```

### Pushing to a route <sup class="new-tag-1">New</sup>

This is simply redirecting to a route and can be done using `push`. `push` also allows you to reference the route by it's name instead of it's path.

```php
$app->router()->push("/home");
```

When an array is passed into push, Leaf will search for a route name matching the string in the array and redirect to that route:

```php
// home was defined above
$app->router()->push(["home"]);
```

## Handling 404

Leaf's core router has specially prepared for 404 errors, and is bent on giving users full control over displaying this error

For this reason, we've prepared the set404() method. In version 2, you can just call set404 without passing in any function, this will set the 404 handler to the default Leaf 404 page. You can change this at any time by passing in your custom page

```php
// will use default Leaf 404 page
$app->set404();

// custom 404 page
$app->set404(function() use($app) {
  $app->response->renderPage("./pages/404.html");
});
```
