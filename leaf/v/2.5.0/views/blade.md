# üî™ Blade Templating

<div class="alert -warning">
Blade will be replaced by Bare UI as the default Leaf templating engine in the next release. This won't affect Leaf MVC and Leaf API. Also, you can always install <code>leafs/blade</code> to continue using blade if that's what you prefer.
</div>

This is Leaf's implementation of Laravel's blade templating engine. It is an independent package, but has been added and bound to Leaf Core. So just like other packages, you don't need to instanciate it if you don't want to.

```php
// on the leaf object
$app->blade;
```

If you don't use blade or don't want it attached to the leaf instance, you can remove it with a simple leaf config:

```php
$app = new Leaf\App([
    "views.blade" => false,
]);
```

```php
// initialising the package
$blade = new Leaf\Blade();
```

## Usage

To further understand blade, you can view the official documentation [http://laravel.com/docs/5.8/blade](http://laravel.com/docs/5.8/blade).

Leaf Blade only supports directory configurations, which can be passed as params on initialisation.

```php
use Leaf\Blade;

// Blade("template dir", "cache dir");
$blade = new Blade('app/views', 'app/views/cache');
```

Not to worry, you can configure blade at a later time after initialisation.

```php
$blade = new Leaf\Blade;

// somewhere, maybe in a different file
$blade->configure("app/views", "app/views/cache");
```

Since Blade is also bound directly to the Leaf object, you can directly do this

```php
$app->blade->configure("app/views", "app/views/cache");
```

Now that this is done, we can render our blade template. This is done with `make`.

```php
// don't forget to chain the render method
echo $blade->make('index', ['name' => 'Michael Darko'])->render(); // index.blade.php
```

Alternatively you can use the shorthand method render:

```php
echo $blade->render('index', ['name' => 'Michael Darko']);
```

We can have this as our template index.blade.php

```html
<!Doctype html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>{{ $name }}</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div class="container">{{ $name }}</div>
    </body>
</html>
```

You can also extend Blade using the `directive()` function:

```php
$blade->directive('datetime', function ($expression) {
    return "<?php echo with({$expression})->format('F d, Y g:i a'); ?>";
});
```

Which allows you to use the following in your blade template:

```html
Current date: @datetime($date)
```

The Blade instances passes all methods to the internal view factory. So methods such as exists, file, share, composer and creator are available as well. Check out the [original documentation](http://laravel.com/docs/5.8/blade) for more information.
