# Leaf Framework Beta Zone

A lot of changes have gone on in Leaf even since the beta release a month ago, a few additions, changes and removals, however, some of these are incomplete or not production ready, but have been added for 'general' feedback. Beta Zone is a collection of such components.

**KINDA PRODUCTION READY**. This is a simple helper for passwords which allows you to quickly and efficiently work with password (encrypting, verifying...)

**WORKS, BUT NOT READY**. Another crazy idea. Makes using JS in your PHP easierüòµü§î. Console log and Localstorage only are currently supported

## [Leaf Tokens](leaf/v/2.4/beta-zone/token) <sup><span style="background: rgb(201, 150, 70); color: white; padding: 3px 7px; font-size: 12px;">BETA</span></sup>

**STILL NOT SURE**. This is supposed to be a replacement for JWT. It's upoosed to provide a more manageable and easily decodeable string as compared to other systems like JWT.
**Requires PHP 7.2+**
