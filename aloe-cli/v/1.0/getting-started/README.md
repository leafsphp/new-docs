# Aloe CLI: Getting Started

Aloe CLI is a smart CLI that takes care of a lot of a whole lot of time consuming tasks during your development, allowing you to focus only on important stuff.

**Aloe is based on the symfony console, with that, all symfony commands are also valid aloe commands and can be called through the aloe cli.**

*v1.0 of Aloe is only fully supported by Leaf MVC and Leaf API, as some commands may not work on other setups.*

## Installation

As mentioned, other systems may not fully support Aloe, but you can install Aloe with composer.

```sh
composer require leafs/aloe
