Leaf MVC core provides core functionality for transforming leaf into a full blown MVC framework. MVC core includes functionality like shortcut functions and helpers which can be used throughout your application.

## Installation

You can easily install MVC Core using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

```bash
composer require leafs/mvc-core
```

## Including in earlier versions (Leaf MVC/API)

You can include mvc core in earlier versions of Leaf MVC and Leaf API manually simply by removing the already existing `Config/functions.php` and `Config/bootstrap.php` files. That's it.

## Basic Usage

Once you've installed Leaf MVC core, you are set to start converting leaf into a full MVC framework. Just bring in vendor/autoload
