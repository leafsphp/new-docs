Leaf is a PHP framework that helps you create clean, simple but powerful web apps and APIs quickly and easily. Leaf introduces a cleaner and much simpler structure to the PHP language while maintaining it's flexibility. With a simple structure and a shallow learning curve, it's an excellent way to rapidly build powerful and high performant web apps and APIs.

## ‚ú® The Leaf Ecosystem

Leaf also has a bunch of tools which help you build **faster**, **more scaleable** solutions quicker than ever.

<p class="alert -info">
  Checkout the new release of Aloe CLI. Aloe replaces the standard console tools in Leaf API, Leaf MVC and SKeleton. <a href="/#/aloe-cli/">Read the docs</a>
</p>

### üéÆ Leaf CLI

Leaf CLI is a console tool for creating and managing Leaf projects. Read the guide [here](/cli/)

### üìÑ Leaf API

<p class="alert -info">
  Leaf API v2 (Aloe) has just been released. Aloe builds on the changes from Leaf PHP and takes API development to a whole new level of ease. <a href="/#/leaf-api/v/2.0/">Read the docs</a>
</p>

Leaf API is a lightweight PHP MVC framework for rapid API development. LeafAPI serves as minimal MVC wrapper around Leaf PHP Framework which allows you to use Leaf in an MVC environment. It also comes along with a bunch of handy tools which can speed up your development by leaguesüôÇ

[Read the docs](/leaf-api/) and contribute to [Leaf API](https://github.com/leafsphp/leafAPI).

### ü¶¥ Skeleton

You can also try out [**Skeleton**](//github.com/leafsphp/skeleton) which provides an easy to use, customizable structure for your Leaf apps. Skeleton gives you some advantages of full blown frameworks like Leaf MVC without the restrictions it comes with.

#### üìï Leaf MVC

<p class="alert -info">
  Leaf MVC v2 (üëë Basil, the ‚Äòkingly‚Äô herb) has just been released. Aloe builds on the changes from Leaf PHP and takes MVC development to a whole new level of ease. <a href="/#/leaf-mvc/v/2.0/">Read the docs</a>
</p>

Leaf MVC provides an MVC wrapper around Leaf itself. So you can use all of Leaf's cool features alongside a nice set of development tools offered by Leaf MVC.

Although Leaf MVC is useable, there's still a lot of work to be done on it. You can also help with it's development.

**Checkout [Leaf MVC](/leaf-mvc).**

#### üòé Leaf UI

Leaf UI is a php framework for building user interfacesüòÖ. As weird as this sounds, this is another project being actively developed.

Leaf UI allows you to focus almost entirely on writing your php application. Instead of having to build interfaces with html, with weird formatting and string interpolations everywhere, Leaf UI gives you a PHP replacement.

Not only does it allow you skip annoying HTML, but also with integrations like [wynter](https://github.com/leafsphp/leaf-ui/tree/wynter), you can write fully-powered Leaf UI relying on PHP alone.

**[Read the docs](ui/)**

As amazing as Leaf UI is, it's still under development and has a whole lot of work left to be done. [Contribute to the Leaf UI](https://github.com/leafsphp/leaf-ui)
