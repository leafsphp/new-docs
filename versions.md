## Contributing

### Pull Request Guidelines

- The `master` branch is just a snapshot of the latest stable release. All development should be done in dedicated branches. **Do not submit PRs against the `master` branch.**

- Checkout a topic branch from the relevant branch, e.g. `dev`, and merge back against that branch.

- It's OK to have multiple small commits as you work on the PR - GitHub will automatically squash it before merging.

- If adding a new feature:
  - Add accompanying use case.
  - Provide a convincing reason to add this feature..

- If fixing bug:
  <!-- - If you are resolving a special issue, add `(fix #xxxx[,#xxxx])` (#xxxx is the issue id) in your PR title for a better release log, e.g. `update entities encoding/decoding (fix #3899)`. -->
  - Provide a detailed description of the bug in the PR.
