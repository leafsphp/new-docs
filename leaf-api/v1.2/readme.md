# LeafAPI

Leaf API is a lightweight PHP MVC framework for rapid API development. LeafAPI serves as minimal MVC wrapper around Leaf PHP Framework which allows you to use Leaf in an MVC environment. With a simple structure and a shallow learning curve, it's an excellent way to rapidly build powerful and high performant APIs.

## Installation

### Composer

You can quickly create a Leaf API project with [composer](https://getcomposer.org).

```bash
composer create-project leafs/api <project-name>
```

### Leaf CLI <sup class="new-tag-1">NEW</sup>

Leaf CLI is a console tool for creating and managing Leaf projects. Read the guide [here](/cli)

```bash
leaf create <project-name> --api
```

This will create a new Leaf API project named `<project-name>`. Inside the new directory, you should have a structure like this.

```bash
C:.
├───App
│   ├───Console
│   ├───Controllers
│   ├───Database
│   │   ├───Factories
│   │   ├───Migrations
│   │   └───Seeds
│   ├───Helpers
│   ├───Models
│   └───Views
├───Config
│   └───Command
├───Lib
├───public
├───storage
│   ├───app
│   │   └───public
│   ├───framework
│   │   └───views
│   └───logs
└───vendor
```

In the project root, you can open up your console tool and type in

```bash
php leaf serve
```

This will start the php web server and load your project at `http://localhost:5500` by default.
