# Leaf API Paths <sup class="new-tag-1">New</sup>

Paths define where Leaf API should look for items throughout the file system. Also these paths are available as methods you can call.

## Available Paths

```php
commands_path("ExampleCommand.php");
```

```php
config_path("Console.php");
```

views_path("assets/css/app.css");
// => App/Views/assets/css/app.css

views_path("assets/css/app.css", false);
// => App/Views/assets/css/app.css

// => /App/Views/assets/css/app.css
```
